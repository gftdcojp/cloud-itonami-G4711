  "Retail Governor -- the independent compliance layer that earns the
  RetailOps-LLM the right to commit. The LLM has no notion of
  jurisdictional consumer-protection/unit-pricing law, whether a
  claimed sale total actually equals the order's own quantity times
  unit-price, whether a SKU's own barcode is a genuine GS1 EAN-13,
  whether a unit price actually falls within the SKU's own declared
  price band, whether a reorder is actually justified by the SKU's own
  recorded stock level, or when an act stops being a draft and becomes
  a real-world sale or reorder, so this MUST be a separate system able
  to *reject* a proposal and fall back to HOLD.

  This is the FIRST vertical in this fleet built on TOP of a real,
  pre-existing bespoke domain capability library (`kotoba-lang/
  retail`) rather than self-contained domain logic -- `retailops.
  registry` calls `kotoba.retail/ean13-valid?` and `kotoba.retail/
  needs-reorder?` directly rather than reimplementing them. This
  blueprint's own `docs/business-model.md` already publishes a
  detailed `:retail-governor` Decision Rule (written before this
  actor existed) naming exactly the checks below; this governor
  implements that published design faithfully rather than inventing
  one from a generic template.

  `:itonami.blueprint/governor` is `:retail-governor`, grep-verified
  UNIQUE fleet-wide -- no naming-collision precedent question, a
  fresh independent build following the SAME governed-actor
  architecture (langgraph StateGraph + independent Governor + Phase
  0->3 rollout) established by `cloud-itonami-isic-6511`.

  Six checks, in priority order, ALL HARD violations: a human approver
  CANNOT override them. The confidence/actuation gate is SOFT: it asks
  a human to look (low confidence / actuation), and the human may
  approve -- but see `retailops.phase`: for `:stake :actuation/post-
  sale`/`:actuation/commit-reorder` (a real sale or reorder) NO phase
  ever allows auto-commit either. Two independent layers agree that
  actuation is always a human call.

    1. Spec-basis                  -- did the jurisdiction proposal cite
                                       an OFFICIAL source
                                       (`retailops.facts`), or invent
                                       one?
    2. Evidence incomplete         -- for `:sale/post`/`:reorder/
                                       commit`, has the jurisdiction
                                       actually been assessed with a
                                       full evidence checklist on file?
    3. Sale total mismatch         -- for `:sale/post`, INDEPENDENTLY

                                       `quantity x unit-price`
                                       (`retailops.registry/sale-

                                       is actually at or below its own

                                       (stock level vs. sale total).
    7. Confidence floor / actuation
       gate                          -- LLM confidence below threshold,
                                       OR the op is `:sale/post`/
                                       `:reorder/commit` (REAL acts) ->
                                       escalate.

  Two more guards, double-post/double-commit prevention, are enforced
  but NOT listed as numbered HARD checks above because they need no
  upstream comparison at all -- `already-sold-violations`/`already-
  reordered-violations` refuse to post/commit the SAME order twice,
  off dedicated `:sale-posted?`/`:reorder-committed?` facts (never a
  `:status` value) -- the SAME 'check a dedicated boolean, not status'
  discipline every prior governor's guards establish, informed by
  `cloud-itonami-isic-6492`'s status-lifecycle bug (ADR-2607071320).

  A further additive HARD guard, `cold-chain-handoff-violations`
  (superproject ADR-2800000500): a `:reorder/receive` (or any other)
  proposal whose `:value` carries BOTH a `:handoff` record (the wire
  shape an upstream cold-chain 3PL such as cloud-itonami-jsic-4721
  populates on ITS OWN outbound dispatch -- same field names as that
  repo's own ADR-2607177600 `:handoff`, no shared code, no shared
  store) AND a `:storage-zone-id` naming which of this store's own
  cold-storage zones (`retailops.facts/cold-storage-zones`) the
  delivery is being placed into is independently checked via
  `retailops.registry/handoff-window-overlaps-storage-zone?` --
  catching a temperature-tier mismatch (e.g. a frozen delivery placed
  into a refrigerated zone) before it reaches this actor's own store.
  Optional on both fields, same asymmetric discipline as every other
  cross-actor reference check in this fleet: a proposal missing either
  field is never held on this basis."
