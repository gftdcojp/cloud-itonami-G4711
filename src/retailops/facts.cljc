  "Per-jurisdiction consumer-protection/fair-trading AND unit-pricing/
  price-marking regulatory catalog -- the G2-style spec-basis table
  the Retail Governor checks every `:jurisdiction/assess` proposal
  against ('did the advisor cite an OFFICIAL public source for this
  jurisdiction's requirements, or did it invent one?').

  This blueprint's own text (docs/business-model.md's already-written
  `:retail-governor` Decision Rule) names 'unit price vs. the
  catalog's price band' as one of the two things the governor's DMN
  check clears a sale against -- a real, distinct regulatory concern:
  most jurisdictions require retail unit pricing to be transparent and
  non-deceptive, with a dedicated legal regime independent of general
  consumer-protection law. Each jurisdiction entry below therefore
  cites BOTH the general consumer-protection/fair-trading law AND a
  SEPARATE unit-pricing/price-marking law.

  Coverage is reported HONESTLY (see `coverage`), the same discipline
  every sibling actor's `facts` namespace uses: a jurisdiction not in
  this table has NO spec-basis, full stop -- the advisor must not
  fabricate one, and the governor holds if it tries. As with
  `leathergoods`/9523's own brand-authenticity sub-citation and
  `ictrepair`/9511's own media-sanitization sub-citation, ALL NINE
  seeded jurisdictions actually have a real unit-pricing/price-marking
  enforcement regime here, reported honestly rather than forcing an
  artificial gap -- including MEX, whose closest statutory analog is a
  net-content/quantity declaration (NOM-030-SCFI-2006) rather than a
  literal per-unit shelf price, reported as such rather than
  overstating the regime, and SAU, whose general consumer-protection
  citation is the currently-ENACTED Anti-Commercial Fraud Law rather
  than the still-in-draft 'Consumer Protection Law' (public
  consultation ongoing as of 2024) -- the not-yet-enacted draft is
  never cited as if it were live law. AUS is a further honesty-note
  case, but the opposite shape from SAU: its unit-pricing sub-citation
  (the Competition and Consumer (Industry Codes--Unit Pricing)
  Regulations 2021) is itself a REMADE instrument that repealed and
  replaced an earlier Trade Practices (Industry Codes--Unit Pricing)
  Regulations 2009 -- the currently-in-force 2021 citation is used,
  never the superseded 2009 one. AUS is also the first seeded
  jurisdiction where the SAME authority (the ACCC) administers both
  the general consumer-protection citation and the separate
  unit-pricing citation -- unlike every other seeded jurisdiction's own
  dedicated metrology/standards body for price -- because Australia's
  unit-pricing regime is structured as a Part IVB industry code under
  the very same Act as the general consumer law, not a separate
  weights-and-measures statute; still a genuinely SEPARATE legal
  instrument (a distinct regulation, schedule and code of conduct),
  just administered by one regulator instead of two, reported as such
  rather than papering over the structural difference.")

(def catalog
  "iso3 -> requirement map. `:required-evidence` mirrors the generic
  SKU-registration/pricing-authorization/sale-record evidence set
  (PLUS a unit-pricing-disclosure record for every seeded
  jurisdiction); `:legal-basis` / `:owner-authority` / `:provenance`
  are the G2 citation the governor requires before any
  `:jurisdiction/assess` proposal can commit. `:price-owner-authority`

  unit-pricing/price-marking citation the governor's
  `price-band-violation?` check is grounded in."
